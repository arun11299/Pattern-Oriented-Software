Pattern-Oriented-Software
=========================
Code presented here can be used anywhere by anyone with a good reason, but no gurantee is given that it would run and 
perform as per users need. 

C++ codes for pattern oriented software architecture course by Douglas Schmidt.

As mentioned, code written under this repo is in C++ and makes use of ACE libraries and boost (in some cases).

Design pattern followed are:
1. Wrapper Facade.
2. Monitor pattern.
3. Half Async/Half Sync design pattern.

Some examples also demonstrates safe use of locking patterns, for eg: in case of the dining philosophers problem.

Other examples, basically demostrate the server designing patterns for designing high performance server side applications in C++.
This is also one of my most interesting areas :).
